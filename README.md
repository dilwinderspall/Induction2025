The energy in the auditorium remained high as **Dr. Arashdeep Singh** took the stage. In a soulful and thought-provoking address, he emphasized that **food is not just fuel, but a foundation** — influencing concentration, mood, and overall academic performance. His words left a lasting impression on students, encouraging a lifestyle of balance, health, and awareness.

As the day neared its conclusion, the **Head of the Department of Applied Sciences** delivered an insightful lecture on academic planning and support systems.
