## 📝 A Reflective Narrative

The morning kicked off with anticipation as students stepped into the academic world with their **first-ever English Proficiency Test**.

Post-lunch, the entire cohort gathered in the college auditorium for a deeply impactful session by the **Satya Scholarship Program team**. Their initiative promised financial support for **50 students**, with an inspiring focus on **female students, orphans, and the differently-abled**. This wasn’t just a financial aid session — it was a message of inclusivity and encouragement, showing GNDEC’s commitment to opportunity for all.

The energy in the auditorium remained high as **Dr. Arashdeep Singh** took the stage. In a soulful and thought-provoking address, he emphasized that **food is not just fuel, but a foundation** — influencing concentration, mood, and overall academic performance. His words left a lasting impression on students, encouraging a lifestyle of balance, health, and awareness.

As the day neared its conclusion, the **Head of the Department of Applied Sciences** delivered an insightful lecture on academic planning and support systems. The HOD outlined the department's teaching methodology, values, and structure, assuring students of the guidance and mentorship available to help them succeed throughout their academic journey.

By **4:30 PM**, students left the campus not just as attendees of an induction event, but as inspired learners — carrying with them the values of **knowledge, empathy, discipline, and purpose**.
